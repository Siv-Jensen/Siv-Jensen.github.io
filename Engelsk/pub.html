            <h2>Why Scotland?</h2>
            <p>
                Scotland may just be the best place to visit in order to destress.Though we all love our kids, they can really grow to be a handful sometimes. And in these times,
                there cannot be a better way to destress than to run off to Scotland to a scottish pub with your closest mates.
                The atmosphere of a scottish pub is like no other, the games they show on the screens, the drinks, the gambling,
                the constant yelling whenever something interesting happens on the screens and the constant bar fights all together create the perfect enviornment for a much needed break from everyday life.
